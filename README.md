# Auto_Contrast_Stack
A short script and macro to enhance contrast in an image stack. 

Auto_contrast_stack.ijm is a macro which can be installed on Fiji / ImageJ to perform the auto-contrasting of a stack of images. ABC_each_image.js is referenced by the Auto_contrast_stack.ijm macro and acts as a short Javascript which uses Fiji's Enhance Contrast command to set the saturation and normalization of pixels in each image. 

More information on the Enhance Contrast command can be found in the ImageJ documentation:
